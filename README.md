# 🍕 SQL Food Delivery Insights

This SQL project is focused on analyzing food delivery data to derive actionable business insights. It simulates real-world use cases faced by growth and marketing teams in a food delivery business, like customer acquisition, retention, and promotions.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset contains a single `orders` table with the following columns:
- `Order_id`
- `Customer_code`
- `Placed_at`
- `Restaurant_id`
- `Cuisine`
- `Order_status`
- `Promo_code_Name`

All data is simulated and covers various cuisines, promo usage, and customer behaviors across multiple cities.
